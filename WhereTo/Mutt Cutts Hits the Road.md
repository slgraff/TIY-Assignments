# Mutt Cutts Hits the Road
# Objectives

Extend the functionality of the app we built in class today. Allow the user to enter two cities and reverse geocode them so you can show pins on the map. Adjust the map to fit both pins. Then find the line-of-sight distance between these two cities (in miles) and display that number to the user. Try Providence, RI and Aspen, CO as two cities to test. They are quite far apart, so this will provide a good test for the map region adjustment code.

### Explorer Mode
* [x] Add a navigation bar and a + bar button item.
* [ ] When tapped, the + button should open a popover that provides the user with two textfields. Collect a city, state from the user for each textfield and then close the popover
	* NOTES: Need to use a UIPopoverPresentationController
* [ ] Map those two cities by dropping pins.
* [ ] Calculate the line-of-sight distance between those two cities and display it in miles somewhere on the screen. ### Adventurer Mode
* [ ] Instead of calculating line-of-sight distance, look in the documentation to find a way to calculate the driving distance and display that to the user.
* [ ] Draw a line on the map betweeen the cities using the driving directions you got from the above step.
