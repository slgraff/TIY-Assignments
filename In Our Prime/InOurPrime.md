# In Our Prime

A prime number is a number that can be evenly divided by 1 and itself. Primes are useful for all sorts of things, but how do we check if a number is prime?

### Storyboard Tasks
* [ ] Create an intuitive layout for a textfield, a button and a label.
* [ ] Create an intuitive way to select which of the PrimeBrain functions you want the button to perform.

### Code Challenge
* [x] Create a class called PrimeBrain
* [x] Create a method in PrimeBrain that takes an NSUInteger and returns YES if prime, and NO if not prime.
* [x] Create a method in PrimeBrain that takes an NSUInteger and returns an array containing all of the prime factors of that number.
* [x] Create a method in PrimeBrain that takes two numbers, gets the prime factors of each of those, then takes the two NSArrays and finds the largest common number contained in them.
