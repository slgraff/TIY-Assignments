# Star Wars Cells

Create a UITableView App that uses three different custom UITableViewCells. Include images!


### Normal Mode
Create a single view application that shows a list of characters from the new Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens in a tableview.

##### JSON
Create a JSON file with the following information in it: Character Name, description, the filename of an image for that character.

Each cell in the tableiview character must display an image, a description of the character and the name of the character.

##### Three Different Custom TableviewCells
Create three different subclasses of UITableViewCell for each character. Each one will display the character in a different way. For example, one may have the image on the left, one may have the image on the right and one might not have an image -- it is up to you.

Hint  
Start with the most trivial implementation of the tableview (default tableviewcell) and build from there, one step at a time.

Objectives  
After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

* have additional practice with model classes, creating JSON files and reading from them, and showing a tableview of data in a straightforward way to the user.


### Assignment Checklist

#### Normal Mode

* [x] Create a JSON file to use for your input data
* [x] Read in the JSON file in the view controller and create a model object for each record.
* [x] Display the name and one of the attributes in a default cell

#### Hard Mode

* [ ] Create a new View Controller, with a detailed profile of the character. Pass only one variable to the class to display the information.
